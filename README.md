# simple-search
A simple search tool for searching a directory of text files for keywords

To run:

Install Python (I'm using v3.12.3)

On the command prompt: python simplesearch.py <path to directory with text files in>

You will be given a search prompt.  You can either enter ':quit' to quit, or enter multiple words.

The words will be reported in rank order (top ten) of percentage content in the files.
